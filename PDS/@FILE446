//***FILE 446 is from John McKown and contains a COBOL program      *   FILE 446
//*           which uses OS/390 UNIX services.  It's good to have   *   FILE 446
//*           a program like this, for a coding example.            *   FILE 446
//*                                                                 *   FILE 446

//*     This program is a small example (341 lines of code) of      *   FILE 446
//*     how to use COBOL to write an OS/390 UNIX System Services    *   FILE 446
//*     program. The program uses the BPX1WRT subroutine to         *   FILE 446
//*     write to STDOUT. It uses this interface to write the        *   FILE 446
//*     UNIX parameters (like C's argc and argv).  It also uses     *   FILE 446
//*     that interface to write out the currently set               *   FILE 446
//*     environment variables.  For example:                        *   FILE 446
//*                                                                 *   FILE 446
//*     ./UNIX0002 arg1 arg2 arg3                                   *   FILE 446
//*                                                                 *   FILE 446
//*     would result in output such as:                             *   FILE 446
